##WHAT IS PHPExecute?


PHPExecute is the fastest way to run/test/debug your PHP code. Here are some of the cool things about it:

 - Very fast way to test your code
 - Nice friendly interface
 - Code  Highlighting
 - Useful PHP, system information panel
 - Saving favorite code snippets
 - Adding useful classes
 - Easy to extend as per your needs
 
##Extending PHPExecute

The good thing is that you can download (see below) it, see its source code and extend it however you like according to your needs. For example, you can add classes for testing, performance or any other purpose. One can even integrate bash commands (I am not going into details of that) to make it even more useful tool to work with.

##Usage Notes

 - PHPExecute uses eval function to run the code. It is strongly recommended that you should use that tool for local testing only and not on production server due to security reasons. If you do, you use it on your own risk.
 
 - In order to save snippets, PHPExecute uses localStorage feature which is available in latest browsers (and IE9+) only and also it can be around 5MB in size. This isn’t that ideal of you are going to save a lot of snippets but you can always extend PHPExecute to add database support and save your snippets there.
